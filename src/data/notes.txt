My Doctoral research was on damage characterization and residual strength prediction for carbon fiber composite materials using non-destructive scanning techniques, finite element modeling, and experimental testing. I developed post-processing software in Matlab to convert complex 3D X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scan data into structured damage information for models and visualizations. I created automated Python and Matlab scripts to generate finite element models that incorporated the results from my damage processing, and compared the model results with experiments.
